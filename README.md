# Anroid - Watchdog Anti Theft

Watchdog Anti Theft is a security based application which uses voice activation features to enable features of the app in the case that it is lost or stolen. The app is built using a combination of Java and Kotlin as well as design patterns to keep the code clean such as MVP to separate business and persistence logic from the views. The code is reusable across any Android project that uses Java & Kotlin
